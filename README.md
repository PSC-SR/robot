The robot.zip file is used extracted by the beagleboard and used to launch the program code. It should be placed in the top level of the memory stick, alongside the robotpy and robotc++ folders, as it will be calling these folders. Unfortanatley you can't extract and then recompress this zip due to weird compression techniques carried out by SR - I asked them and even they didn't know what was going on with it - so if you want to modify it you will need to use the SR IDE.
